# PolicySampler
Sample policies using MCMC/multicanonical sampling

Wang Landau algorithm (WA) used to obtain the density of states of a system characterized by a cost function. We propose WA to obtain the density  of 


In physics to do random walks in the energy space. In this project we propose using WA to do random walks in the parameter space of a agent's policy such return  


$V(S_0; \theta) = \Sum_{t=1}^T \gamma^t r_t $


Wang-Landau Algorithm components:
- Modification Factor: $f$
- Histogram: $H$
- Cost/Energy/Return: $E$
- log density of states $g(E)$
